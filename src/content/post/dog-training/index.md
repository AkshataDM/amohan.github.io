I wanted to share a few learnings from training my dogs. I want to keep it short because I'm not a trainer and the dogs and I are still a work in progress. For context, I have an Aussie shepherd mix and a border collie. They're both beautiful, lovely dogs each in their own chaotic way, and they both have their adorable little neuroses.
For example, Mika, Aussie shepherd mix, is a spicy little social gremlin in public who needs either a "job" to do outside or to be the main character everywhere we go. Gussie, on the other hand, is a total restaurant dog, but doesn't like other dogs, the Roomba orthat random neighbour dog barking outside.  So figuring out what works for each little weirdo is very helpful in training them (and maintaining my sanity).

1. Know your dog. Not all dogs can be social butterflies, and forcing them to be something they're not is like trying to teach a fish to climb a tree. Utterly pointless exercise.
2. Dogs can read expressions and can sense your moods before you even know you're having them. They get anxious when we get angry, sad or anxious. 
3. Do not repeat commands. It's really true though. Say it once, give it some time, and they will follow. Only repeat if you think they genuinely didn't hear you.
4. Be consistent in your language. Keep the same word for each task and stick to it. Human language is already very confusing to them - imagine trying to learn a new language from someone who says "sit," "sit down," "park it," and "plant your butt" all for the same thing.
5. As much as possible, try to associate words with body language. This will help them attune to your body language. 
6. Did I already mention that these poor babies don't understand English? They're not going to magically understand "Sit" and "Stay" through telepathy. Try to associate words as they are doing it. For example, ti teach sit, say the word "sit" as they are naturally going to do a sit. Lots of patience is key.
7. They pick up on emotions fast. Even if you have a full volcanic eruption happening in your head, keep your tone neutral with them so they don't absorb your stress. 

I'll share more as we progress. Happy dog training!
